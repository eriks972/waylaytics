"(a) Local income taxes are excluded. Ten states have county- or city-level income taxes; the average effective rates expressed as a percentage of AGI within each jurisdiction (data for 2022, the latest year available, come from the IRS and U.S. Census Bureau) are: AL--0.09%; IN--0.49%; IA--0.09%; KY--1.31%; MD--2.51%; MI--0.18%; MO--0.21%; NY--1.68%; OH--1.49%; PA--1.07%. In CA, CO, DE, KS, NJ, OR, and WV some jurisdictions have payroll taxes, flat-rate wage taxes, or interest and dividend income taxes. See Jared Walczak, Janelle Fritts, and Maxwell James, “Local Income Taxes: A Primer,” Tax Foundation, February 23, 2023, https://taxfoundation.org/local-income-taxes-2023/.",,,,,,,,,,,
(b) These states allow some or all of federal income tax paid to be deducted from state taxable income.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(c) For single taxpayers with AGI not exceeding $25,999, the standard deduction is $3,000. This standard deduction amount is reduced by $25 for every additional $500 of AGI, not to fall below $2,500. For Married Filing Joint (MFJ) taxpayers with AGI not exceeding $25,999, the standard deduction is $8,500. This standard deduction amount is reduced by $175 for every additional $500 of AGI, not to fall below $5,000. For all taxpayers with AGI of $50,000 or less and claiming a dependent, the dependent exemption is $1,000. This amount is reduced to $500 per dependent for taxpayers with AGI above $50,000 and equal to or less than $100,000. For taxpayers with more than $100,000 in AGI, the dependent exemption is $300 per dependent.",,,,,,,,,,,
(d) Standard deduction and/or personal exemption is adjusted annually for inflation. Inflation-adjusted amounts for tax year 2025 are shown.,,,,,,,,,,,
(e) Arizona's standard deduction can be adjusted upward by an amount equal to 33 percent (as of TY 2024) of the amount the taxpayer would have claimed in charitable deductions if the taxpayer had claimed itemized deductions.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(f) In lieu of a dependent exemption, Arizona offers a dependent tax credit of $100 per dependent under the age of 17 and $25 per dependent age 17 and older. The credit begins to phase out for taxpayers with federal adjusted gross income (FAGI) above $200,000 (single filers) or $400,000 (MFJ).",,,,,,,,,,,
"(g) Rates apply to individuals earning more than $89,600. A separate tax tables exist for individuals earning $89,600 or less, with rates of 2 percent on income greater than or equal to $5,300; 3 percent on income greater than or equal to $10,600; 3.4 percent on income greater than or equal to $15,100; and 3.9 percent on income greater than $25,000 but less than or equal to $89,600. ",,,,,,,,,,,
(h) Standard deduction or personal exemption is structured as a tax credit.,,,,,,,,,,,
"(i) Connecticut and New York have ""tax benefit recapture,"" by which many high-income taxpayers pay their top tax rate on all income, not just on amounts above the benefit threshold.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(j) Bracket levels adjusted for inflation each year. Inflation-adjusted bracket widths for 2025 were not available as of publication, so table reflects 2024 inflation-adjusted bracket widths.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(k) Exemption credits phase out for single taxpayers by $6 for each $2,500 of federal AGI above $237,035 and for MFJ filers by $12 for each $2,500 of federal AGI above $474,075. The credit cannot be reduced to below zero.",,,,,,,,,,,
"(l) Rates include the additional mental health services tax at the rate of 1 percent on taxable income in excess of $1 million. Rates exclude a payroll tax of 1.1 percent to fund the state’s disability insurance program. Effecting as of TY 2024, there is no wage ceiling for this payroll tax, which means that the state’s top individual income tax rate on wage income becomes 14.4 percent.",,,,,,,,,,,
